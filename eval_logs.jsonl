Introduction**\nThis report summarizes key strategies for effective context management and outlines the evolution of interaction methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), as presented by Adithya Krishnan.\n\n**II. Strategies for Context Management**\nAdithya Krishnan detailed several approaches to manage context efficiently, particularly in agentic systems:\n\n*   **Agent State:** Utilizing an agent state to selectively maintain only the most relevant variables across different agents. This helps in keeping the context focused and manageable.\n*   **Summarization vs. Buffer Memory:** For handling longer contexts, a choice exists between summarizing the entire context or employing a buffer memory that retains only the last 'n' outputs. This decision depends on the specific needs for detail retention versus conciseness.\n*   **Vector Store for Context Retrieval:** Storing large volumes of context in a vector store allows agents to retrieve specific, relevant information as and when required. This method is particularly useful for dynamic and extensive knowledge bases.\n\n**III. Evolution of LLM Interaction**\nThe interaction with LLMs has progressed through several stages, each offering enhanced capabilities for accuracy and domain specificity:\n\n*   **Simple Question and Prompt:** The initial and most basic form of interaction, involving direct questions or prompts to the LLM.\n*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** This advanced technique incorporates more context by using a vector store to retrieve relevant information. RAG is crucial for improving the accuracy of LLM responses, especially for domain-specific, company-specific, or less common data.\n*   **Fine-tuning:** For achieving very specific accuracy requirements, fine-tuning an open-source LLM is an option. This process involves creating and utilizing custom question-answer pairs to train the model on a highly specialized dataset.", "sources": ["Strategies for Context Management Adithya Krishnan presented several strategies for effective context management, including using an agent state to maintain only relevant variables across agents (00:34:20).
